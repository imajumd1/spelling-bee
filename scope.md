# Spelling Bee Application - Project Scope

## Project Overview

A web-based implementation of the popular New York Times Spelling Bee puzzle game, featuring a honeycomb letter arrangement where players create words to achieve different scoring levels, with "Genius" status awarded for finding at least 80% of all possible words.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Letter Setup
- **7 unique letters** arranged in a honeycomb pattern
- **1 center letter** (required in every valid word)
- **6 outer letters** (optional but can be used multiple times)

### Word Formation Rules
- Words must be **at least 4 letters long**
- Words must **include the center letter**
- Letters can be **reused multiple times** in a single word
- If **Q appears on Spelling Bee, it must have U as well**
- Only **common English words** are accepted (based on word list)
- **No proper nouns, abbreviations, or hyphenated words**

### Scoring System
- **4-letter words**: 1 point each
- **5+ letter words**: 1 point per letter
- **Pangrams** (words using all 7 letters): Bonus points (typically +7)

### Achievement Levels
- **Beginner**: 0-10% of total points
- **Good Start**: 10-20% of total points  
- **Moving Up**: 20-30% of total points
- **Good**: 30-40% of total points
- **Solid**: 40-50% of total points
- **Nice**: 50-60% of total points
- **Great**: 60-70% of total points
- **Amazing**: 70-80% of total points
- **Genius**: 80%+ of total points ‚≠ê

## Game Balance

### Puzzle Generation
- Ensure **at least 20-30 valid words** per puzzle
- Include **1-2 pangrams** when possible
- Avoid letters that create too few words (like Q, X, Z)
- Target **50-100 total possible points** per puzzle

### Difficulty Curve
- **Genius level at 80%** creates appropriate challenge
